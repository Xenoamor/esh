esh - embedded shell
====================

This is a very simple embedded 'shell' for microcontroller use, for
implementing debug UART consoles and such.


Configuration
=============

esh expects a file called esh_config.h to be on the quoted include path. It
should define the following:

#define ESH_PROMPT      "% "        // Prompt string
#define ESH_BUFFER_LEN  200         // Maximum length of a command
#define ESH_ARGC_MAX    10          // Maximum argument count


Then, to use esh, include esh.h, define a "struct esh" for each esh instance you
want, and make sure to call the following setup functions (fully documented in
esh.h):

esh_init(struct esh * esh);
esh_register_callback(
    struct esh * esh,
    void (*callback)(int argc, char const * const * argv));
esh_register_print(
    struct esh * esh,
    void (*print)(struct esh const * esh, char const * s));


Optionally, you can call the following as well:

esh_register_overflow_callback(
    struct esh * esh,
    int (*callback)(struct esh const * esh, char const * buffer));


Then, as characters are received from your serial interface, feed them in with:

esh_rx(struct esh * esh, char c);


AVR memory spaces
=================

When compiling for AVR, esh automatically uses flash memory for storage of
strings and constant data. This makes use of the named memory spaces in recent
versions of avr-gcc.
