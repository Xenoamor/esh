/**
 * esh - embedded shell
 * ====================
 *
 * *****************************************************************************
 * * PLEASE read ALL of this documentation (all comment blocks starting with a *
 * * double-asterisk **). esh is simple, but a number of things need to be     *
 * * addressed by every esh user.                                              *
 * *****************************************************************************
 *
 * esh is a lightweight command shell for embedded applications in C or rust,
 * small enough to be used for (and intended for) debug UART consoles on
 * microcontrollers. Features include line editing, automatic argument
 * tokenizing (including sh-like quoting), and an optional history ring buffer.

 *
 * 1. Rust users
 * =============
 *
 * Congrats, you're in the right place! Ignore the documentation for the C API,
 * including the "Configuring esh" section. Your usage is a bit different.
 *
 * 2. Configuring esh
 * ==================
 *
 * esh expects a file called `esh_config.h` to be on the quoted include path for
 * the C compiler. It should define the following:
 *
 *     #define ESH_PROMPT       "% "        // Prompt string
 *     #define ESH_BUFFER_LEN   200         // Maximum length of a command
 *     #define ESH_ARGC_MAX     10          // Maximum argument count
 *     #define ESH_ALLOC        STATIC      // How to allocate esh_t (or MALLOC)
 *     #define ESH_INSTANCES    1           // Number of instances, if ^=STATIC
 *
 * Then, to use esh, use `extern crate esh`, and initialize an esh instance:
 *
 *     let mut esh = Esh::init().unwrap();
 *
 * Register your callbacks with:
 *
 *     esh.register_command(command_callback);
 *     esh.register_print(print_callback);
 *
 *     // Optional, see the documentation for this function:
 *     esh.register_overflow(overflow_callback);
 *
 * Now, just begin receiving characters from your serial interface and feeding
 * them in with:
 *
 *     esh.rx(c);
 *
 * 2.1. Line endings
 * -----------------
 *
 * Internally, esh uses strictly `\n` line endings. A great many IO sources use
 * different line endings; the user is responsible for translating them for esh.
 * In general, most raw-mode unix-like terminals will give `\r` from the
 * keyboard and require `\r\n` as output, so your input functions should
 * translate `\r` to `\n`, and your output function should insert `\r` before
 * `\n`.
 *
 * 2.2. History (optional)
 * -----------------------
 *
 * To enable the optional history, define the following in `esh_config.h`:
 *
 *     #define ESH_HIST_ALLOC   STATIC      // STATIC or MALLOC
 *     #define ESH_HIST_LEN     512         // Length. Use powers of 2 for
 *                                          //   efficiency on arithmetic-weak
 *                                          //   devices.
 *
 * WARNING: static allocation is only valid when using a SINGLE esh instance.
 * Using multiple esh instances with static allocation is undefined and WILL
 * make demons fly out your nose.
 *
 * 3. Compiling esh
 * ================
 *
 * esh has Rust and C components, so you need to build and link both. See the
 * included demo under `demo_rust/` for an example using Cargo to do this.
 *
 * 3.1. C components
 * -----------------
 *
 *  1. Put the `esh` subdirectory on the include path.
 *  2. Make sure `esh_config.h` is on the quoted include path (`-iquote`).
 *  3. Make sure selected C standard is one of `c99`, `c11`, `gnu99`, or
 *       `gnu11`.
 *  4. Include *all* esh C source files in the build (whether or not you used
 *       the feature - e.g. esh_hist.c).
 *
 * esh should compile quietly with most warning settings, including
 * `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`.
 *
 * 3.2. Rust components
 * --------------------
 *
 * The Rust bindings can be compiled as any crate. Either use Cargo and make esh
 * a dependency, or build directly with rustc:
 *
 *     rustc --crate-name=esh -o libesh.rlib esh/esh_rust/src/esh/lib.rs
 *
 * 3.3. Linking
 * ------------
 *
 * The final executable must link together the C *.o files and the Rust crate.
 * rlib files are static libraries, and so can be given directly to the linker.
